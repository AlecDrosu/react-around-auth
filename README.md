Around the U.S. project on React, featuring authorization and registration.

This repository will contain your own front-end project on React with added authorization and registration features.
Start working with your previously built front end code from Sprint 11.

All authorization, registration and token requests must go through to the server running on [https://register.nomoreparties.co](https://register.nomoreparties.co/).

Good luck!

## Notes from me:

One important thing to note is that I am using the latest version of React Router v6. This no longer uses the following components:

* Switch
* Redirect
* useHistory

so I am using the following components instead:

* Routes
* Navigate
* useNavigate

Also this project has unfinished mobile design. I saw that it was optional for the project, and since I am strapped for time I have not finished implementing it. I will finish it once I have more time though.
